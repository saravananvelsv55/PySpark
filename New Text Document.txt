8. Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are 
same from a given list of strings.  
Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
Expected Result : 2

9. Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of 
non-empty tuples.  
Sample 
Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]

10. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length 
is less than 2, return instead the empty string.  
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String

11.Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', 
except the first char itself.  
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'

12. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters 
of each string
Sample String : 'abc', 'xyz'
Expected Result : 'xyc abz' 

13. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string is already 
ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.  
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'

14. Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'bad' follows 
the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.  
Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'

15. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.  

16. Write a Python program to test whether an input is an integer.  

17. Write a Python program to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.  

18. Write a Python program to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by key value.  

19. Write a Python program to add key to a dictionary 
Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

20. Write a Python program to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one. 
Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

21. Write a Python program to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary.  

22. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.  

23. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.  

24. Write a Python program to check a list is empty or not.  

25. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list.  

26. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a non empty string.  

27. Write a Python program to change a given string to a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.  

28. Write a Python program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.  

29. Write a Python program to find the list of words that are longer than n from a given list of words. 

30. Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.  

31. Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
